**Hi, Iâ€™m @samuel-luke**

---

I graduated from Utah State University in 2020 while learning remotely during a global pandemic. Yep, I pressed submit on my last final of my undergrad in the closet I called an apartment. Didn't even have a window. Now I'm living in SLC with my beautiful partner and a cat named Fear. In my free time I'm usually cooking or watching cooking shows. I love to sit down and watch long instructional videos on machining, woodworking, and lockpicking despite living in a 2 bedroom apartment in the city. My given name is Samuel, but I'm not named after the biblical prophet, rather I'm named after Dr. Samuel Beckett the time traveller from Quantum Leap. 

Visit my GitHub to see a few of my personal projects - mainly simulations to give me an edge in party games - as well as some featured projects from my schooling. The programming language I always turn to is Python, I love the simple syntax and quick development, not to mention the hundreds of libraries. <!--- I run a PopOS distro with KDE as my desktop enviornment. -->
